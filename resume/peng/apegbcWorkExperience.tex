\section{Introduction}
I, \fullname, request to reinstate my P.eng license. While I do not require a
P.eng license to practice software engineering in its many facets; I do believe
that with the rise of Artificial Intelligence, and the ever increase velocity of
code being produced and shipped
, now more than ever, the human value of a trained and certified engineer adds
tremendous stability to software. \\
I previously served the Royal Canadian navy as a Naval Engineering Officer
where, while onboard a warship advised the commanding officer on the machinery,
technical readiness of the systems and the men under my care and responsability.
Having change career to Software Engineering in 2020 I gave up my license
as retooling to my new field was time consuming and expensive.\\
