## Compute Resources required by the operator container
resources:
  ## We have to ensure that factorio have enough computing resources avaiable. We set here an absolute minimum
  ## Keep in mind that big factorio base can consume a lot of memory and cpu
  requests:
    memory: 3Gi
    cpu: 1500m
  ## If you like to limit factiorio resources
  limits: {}
  # limits:
  #   memory: 1024Mi

## @section Port-Fixer Parameters
## @param port_fixer.enabled Enable the Factorio Port Fixer
## @param image.repository Factorio port-fixer image repository
## @param image.tag Factorio port fixer image tag (immutable tags are recommended)
## @param image.pullPolicy Factorio port fixer image pull policy
## @param image.port Factorio port to announce via port-fixer, defaults to service.port
port_fixer:
  # Adds an extra container that tries to help with connection issues via the public server browser.
  # This is especially useful when you canâ€™t set up outgoing static port mappings and see log messages like these:
  # > Warning ServerRouter.cpp:541: Received own address message reply with conflicting address (got IP ADDR:({<ip>:19296}), expected IP ADDR:({<ip>:58037}))
  # > Warning ServerMultiplayerManager.cpp:651: Determining own address has failed. Best guess: IP ADDR:({<ip>:58037})
  # > Warning ServerRouter.cpp:541: Received own address message reply with conflicting address (got IP ADDR:({<ip>:19297}), expected IP ADDR:({<ip>:58037}))
  # > Warning ServerRouter.cpp:541: Received own address message reply with conflicting address (got IP ADDR:({<ip>:24105}), expected IP ADDR:({<ip>:58037}))
  # Note: Port forwarding for incoming traffic still needs to be set up properly for this to work.
